Hash Functions are the functions that gives us the same output for a particluar input of desired size.A perfect hash function always produces the unique output for a unique input.
H(inp1) = op1

Hashing consist of storing key, value pairs in a HashTable of nodes. The index of the table is the index obtained by hashing the key.

General Hash Functions: (k is the key, M is the size of the HashTable)
1. Division Method -> h(k) = k % M

2. Mid Square Method -> h(k) = h(k*k)
      For 60, the square is 3600, the middle two numbers gives us 60 so that is index/hash.

3. Digit Folding Method -> 
   k = k1, k2, k3, k4, ... , kn (Divide into segments of equal size)
   s = k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 + ... + kn (Take Sum -> s)
   h(k) = s % M
      d = 12345, s = 12 + 34 + 5 
                   = 51

4. Multiplication Method -> h(k) = floor(M * (k*A mod 1))
   Choose a constant A. 0 < A < 1
   k * A
   Extract Fractional Part Of k * A
   Multiply previous step result by M.
   floor the value to an integer.

COLLISIONS:
   Sometimes, the hash function may produce the same output for different keys and hence we have a problem of collision.
   To minimize this:
      1)Good Hash Functions 
      2)More Buckets Capacity
      
   Collision Resolution Techniques
      Chaining (Open Hashing):
         In this we create a LinkedList<Nodes> and store the nodes with same hash values of the keys in the list at that hash index.
         One problem is that it gives time complexity has we are traversing the list in all the operations. To avoid this we use REHASHING.

         Load Factor(Lambda): n/N (n -> Total Elements, N -> No of Buckets)
            It is a factor that decides when to double the array size.
            It is usually 0.75
         
         Threshold Value = Load Factor * Capacity
            It is acceptable entries of elements before capacity is doubled.

         ReHashing:
            It is copying of the nodes from old table to a new table.

      Open Addressing(Closed Hashing):
         In this we check if the next index is empty(Linear Probing), or if the quadratic index is empty(Quadratic Probing)
